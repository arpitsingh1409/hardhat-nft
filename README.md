3 contracts:

1. Basic NFT

2. Random IPFS hosted NFT

   - Pros: Cheap (no gas)
   - Cons: We need to pay for getting our data pinned to other nodes

3. Dynamic SVG NFT (100% on-chain NFT, hence dynamic as image properties change!)

- Pros: On chain data, always on and allows easy interaction
- Cons: Expensive as hell, hosting 2 images, we will go broke!
